# Coach at ClojureBridge

ClojureBridge aims to increase diversity within the Clojure community by offering **free, beginner-friendly Clojure programming workshops for women and non-binary people**. On Friday evening we install the software which is needed and get to know each other. Saturday is for coding in groups, learning and talks.

As a development environment students will be using [NightCode](https://sekao.net/nightcode/).
They will go with you through [our ClojureBridge curriculum](https://clojurebridge-berlin.github.io/curriculum/#/) and build a creative [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) app.

There will be a coaching and awareness training before the workshop.
