# Sponsor Us

ClojureBridge Berlin organizes free programming workshops for members of
underrepresented groups. All organizers, coaches, and assistants volunteer a
part of their free time. To cover costs we rely on the generous patronage of
companies that support us in our cause.

## Rewards

By supporting us you help to make the world a little better. Your company also
gets to associate itself with a positive and ambitious event, which aims to
increase diversity in the technology scene.

Your company has an option of different tiers of support:

### Platinum Sponsor - 600€
* e.g. lunch on workshop day
* Your logo in top placement on our website
* Shoutout on our social media pages
* You can offer swag for our attendees

### Gold Sponsor - 500€
* e.g. swag for the attendees
* Your logo on our website
* Shoutout on our social media pages
* You can offer swag for our attendees

### Small Supporter - 250€
* e.g. coffee & cake on workshop day
* Your logo on our website
* You can offer swag for our attendees

## How does it work?

There's two ways your company can choose to support us:

### Direct Sponsorship

If you've opted for a direct sponsorship (only for Platinum or Gold sponsors), then your transaction will be with
our suppliers directly. In this case, we will give you the exact
link/message/order that we need, and you make the transaction with that
company directly. This means normal business billing, with ability to pay by
credit card, and get an invoice. However, due to the nature of the process,
we can't predict the exact amount — it would depend on factors such as the
the number of sign-ups.

### Support us via donation

Alternatively, we also take donations via the
[Travis Foundation UG](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/), a registered
not-for-profit company (a “Gemeinnützige Organisation” under German law). This
is how we can take the small supporter tier, for donations from 250€. The Travis
Foundation can issue a Donation Receipt for accounting and tax deduction. It
does *not* issue invoices for donations.
