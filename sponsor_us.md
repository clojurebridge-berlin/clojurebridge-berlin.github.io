# Sponsor Us

ClojureBridge Berlin organizes free programming workshops for members of
underrepresented groups. All organizers, coaches, and assistants volunteer a
part of their free time. To cover costs we rely on the generous patronage of
companies that support us in our cause.

## Rewards

By supporting us you help to make the world a little better. Your company also
gets to associate itself with a positive and ambitious event, which aims to
increase diversity in the technology scene.

Your company has an option of different tiers of support. There's the direct
sponsorship tiers, which are the most valuable form of support, and a generic
small supporter tier. The direct sponsorship tiers involve directly paying our
supplier with the order details we provide, and as such also mean you can pay
with credit card and will receive an invoice.

* Platinum tier (~600€): Food for the main event
* Gold Tier (~500€): Notebooks for the Attendees
* Silver Tier (~400€): Food for the coaches training
* Small Supporter Tier (250€)

All our sponsors are listed on our website and on our event page on
ClojureBridge.org. They'll receive a shoutout at the start and end of the event
along with their logos in our presentations. All our sponsors will also have
the opportunity to offer "swag" (stickers, note books, thumb drives, etc.) at
the event.

Additionally, those who sponsored in our top three tiers will also get special
shoutouts on our social media accounts, along with priority placements of their
logos.


## Financial

There's two ways your company can choose to support us:

### Direct Sponsorship

If you've opted for a direct sponsorship tier, then your transaction will be with
our suppliers directly. In this case, we will give you the exact
link/message/order that we need, and you make the transaction with that
company directly. This means normal business billing, with ability to pay by
credit card, and get an invoice. However, due to the nature of the process,
we can't predict the exact amount — it would depend on factors such as the
the number of sign-ups.

### Support us via donation

Alternatively, we also take donations via the
[Travis Foundation UG](http://foundation.travis-ci.org/), a registered
not-for-profit company (a “Gemeinnützige Organisation” under German law). This
is how we can take the small supporter tier, for donations from 250€. The Travis
Foundation can issue a Donation Receipt for accounting and tax deduction. It
does *not* issue invoices for donations.
