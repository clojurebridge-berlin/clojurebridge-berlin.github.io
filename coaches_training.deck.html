<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>You're probably at a coaches training for ClojureBridge.</p>

<p>This slide deck is a tool to facilitate conversations about coaching best practices and challenges, specifically for ClojureBridge workshops.</p>

<p>It helps to have a whiteboard or those giant sticky notes for the discussions if possible.</p>

<h3>Discussion is key!</h3>

<h3>Don't let the presenter(s) do all the talking!</h3>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="why_clojurebridge">

<h2>What's a ClojureBridge?</h2>

<p>Raise your hand if you've been to a workshop before!</p>

<h3>RailsBridge Fun Facts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Founded in 2009</li>
<li>Its goal: make the community more diverse and more welcoming to newcomers.</li>
<li>Since 2012 backed by Bridge Foundry,</li>
<li>Also does MobileBridge, ng-bridge, Teaching Kids, and ... ClojureBridge!</li>
</ul>

<h3>ClojureBridge</h3>

<ul>
<li>First workshop April 2014</li>
<li>Since then over 40 workshops in the US, UK, Ireland, Australia, Scotland, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, Canada, and... Germany!</li>
<li>So far two workshops in Berlin: July 2015, January 2016, and now the third one coming up! 🎉</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="how_does_a_workshop_work">
<h2>How does a workshop work?</h2>

<p>On Friday, we get all the necessary technologies onto the students' computers (the Installfest).</p>

<p>The next day we start with a general introduction, then break into small groups and work through the curriculum, with some talks and breaks in between.</p>

<p>In groups of 3 to 4 students and two coaches we work through the curriculum (a tutorial of Clojure) and then work on a Quil app (graphics library).
Floating coaches are available for extra support.</p>

<p>You get as far as you get, don't rush to "finish" things.</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="installfest">
<h2>Installfest!</h2>

<p>We use NightCode as editor. Of course if people have their own preference then that's fine.</p>

<p>NightCode is pretty easy to install, it's just an executable JAR. We'll have a couple thumb drives to go around.</p>

<p>Actually create and run a Quil project, so all dependencies are downloaded and available.</p>

<h4>Keep in mind:</h4>

<ul>
<li>There will be people with <em>all</em> kinds of computers.</li>
<li>Even though Windows might not be your preferred development environment, we're here to encourage people and meet them wherever they are right now.</li>
<li>Do NOT say bad things about Windows, even if it's frustrating.</li>
<li>If you're not sure about something, grab another volunteer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion: Social Comfort</h2>

<h4>Imagine:</h4>

<ul>
<li>You're trying to do something difficult</li>
<li>You're in a group of strangers, many of whom know how to do it better than you</li>
<li>You've tried before but got lost or bored or confused</li>
<li>You don't feel like you can articulate your thoughts and questions</li>
<li>You don't know the right names for anything</li>
</ul>

<h4>When was the last time you felt this way?</h4>

<h4>How can we help make this easier?</h4>

<h4>How can you help people feel socially comfortable?</h4>

<p>DISCUSS!</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="social_comfort_ideas">
<h2>Social Comfort (Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Introductions</h4>

<ul>
<li>Include name, profession, why are you here / goals for today's class, and something silly.</li>
<li>Don't rush, even if you have a big class.</li>
<li>If someone joins the class late, ask them to introduce themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Icebreakers</h4>

<ul>
<li>Name games! Admit up front that most people are bad at learning new names.</li>
<li>Get people talking. The more comfortable they are at talking, the more likely they'll speak up when they don't understand something, or to answer someone else's question.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="social_comfort_more_ideas">
<h2>Social Comfort (More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Try to suppress your (understandable) culturally-influenced sexism</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't hit on people. No sexual advances. None. Even at the after-party.</li>
<li>Don't make sexist jokes. Or racist, classist, or ableist jokes. Call people out if they do. A simple "That's not funny" and moving on quickly with the conversation will often suffice.</li>
<li>Don't make gender-based generalizations ("Women are better at X, because ...")</li>
<li>Don't make references to people's bodies or state your opinion of them.</li>
<li>Don't use slurs.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="social_comfort_pay_attention_to_pronouns">
<h2>Social Comfort (pay attention to pronouns)</h2>

<ul>
<li>attendees are women and non-binary people</li>
<li>attendees are asked to write down their pronouns on their name tags</li>
<li>please don't assume anybody's gender</li>
<li>refrain from gender specific terms like "hey guys", "hello ladies"</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="social_comfort_even_more_ideas">
<h2>Social Comfort (Even More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Represent the diverse and welcoming community we stand for</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't mock other languages or technologies.</li>
<li>Leave your nerdy flame wars at the door.</li>
<li>Windows is fine. PHP is fine. Javascript is fine.</li>
<li>Be genuinely interested in people's experiences. ("You built something? That's cool. What does it do?")</li>
<li>Appreciate that different technologies have different trade-offs. Being easily accessible is one of them.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="discussion_technical_capability">
<h2>Discussion: Technical Capability</h2>

<h3>How can you help people feel technically capable?</h3>

<h3>What kinds of insecurities might your student have?</h3>

<h3>How can you bolster their confidence?</h3>

<p>DISCUSS!</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="technical_capability_ideas">
<h2>Technical Capability (Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Being confused is normal</h4>

<ul>
<li>Not knowing stuff is normal, even the pros spend half their day googling</li>
<li>If you keep at it it gets better, more quickly than you think</li>
<li>No need to make things perfect. Just build stuff, have fun!</li>
<li>Mistakes == Learning!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Define technical concepts</h4>

<ul>
<li>Define technical terms! Several times!</li>
<li>Assume anyone you're coaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence.</li>
<li>Remember people's backgrounds (Javascript, Ruby, Java, HTML/CSS,) and relate where possible.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to use metaphors. If they are a cook, try a cooking analogy.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="technical_capability_more_ideas">
<h2>Technical Capability (More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Encourage collaboration and interaction</h4>

<ul>
<li>Explicitly encourage students to try to answer each other's questions.</li>
<li>If a question is asked, ask if anyone in the class thinks they can explain.</li>
<li>Be especially encouraging of the first few questions, to try to get things rolling.</li>
<li>Good responses to questions: "I'm glad you asked!" or "I actually wondered that, too." or "Great question!"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Be Super Positive, Always</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students have diverse backgrounds. Appreciate this fact.</li>
<li>If they aren't getting a concept, avoid anything that might shame them.</li>
<li>Don't be surprised when someone hasn't heard of something before.</li>
<li>Don't grab anyone's keyboard. Avoid taking over unless you think it's <em>really</em> necessary. Ask before you do. "Mind if I drive for a sec?" But really, don't.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="technical_capability_even_more_ideas">
<h2>Technical Capability (Even More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Find the right level</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't go too deep for your class level, but also, don't gloss over things.</li>
<li>When trying to be accurate, it's easy to go down a rabbit hole of specificity. Avoid.</li>
<li>Work with the co-coaches to make sure no one goes down that rabbit hole. Accountability!</li>
<li>Explain the big picture of a command <em>before</em> they type it in.

<ul>
<li>i.e., before typing the command to deploy to Heroku, explain the difference between localhost and Heroku.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion (Do you know what's up?)</h2>

<h4>How can you help people feel like you know what's going on?</h4>

<h4>What are things you can do to help the students trust you?</h4>

<h4>What are some things to avoid?</h4>

<p>DISCUSS!</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="know_whats_up_ideas">
<h2>Know What's Up (Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Know what's going on</h4>

<ul>
<li>Mention planned breaks, lunch time</li>
<li>Remind students that there is a closing presentation at the end</li>
<li>Make sure they know where the bathroom is</li>
<li>Let them know they can hang around and socialize afterwards</li>
</ul>

<h4>Establish a few ground rules</h4>

<ul>
<li>Questions are always welcome, even if the student thinks it might be dumb. "That's a <strong>GREAT</strong> question"</li>
<li>Explain that if someone has trouble, the coaches will help troubleshoot.</li>
<li>If anyone wants to switch classes, tell them they should feel TOTALLY COMFORTABLE switching at any point.</li>
<li>Have breaks! Eat a muffin! Have a look at what other groups are doing!</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="know_whats_up_more_ideas">
<h2>Know What's Up (More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Teaching style</h4>

<ul>
<li>Know people's name, and use it</li>
<li>You can correct people in a nice and encouraging way

<ul>
<li>"Well, this might work better and this is why."</li>
<li>"Can you explain how you came to that conclusion?"</li>
<li>"Does anyone have a different answer?"</li>
<li>"Ah, I see what you're trying to do."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ask yourself questions and answer them.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="know_whats_up_even_more_ideas">
<h2>Know What's Up (Even More Ideas)</h2>

<h4>Pace yourself!</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don't go too fast. You will probably go too fast. Check in occasionally to ensure everyone is still with you.</li>
<li>You can say the same thing THREE TIMES and it will not be boring yet.</li>
<li>When you ask a question, wait TEN WHOLE SECONDS before saying anything else. People need time to think.</li>
<li>Don't let the most advanced students dictate the pacing or answer all the questions.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="discussion_challenges">
<h2>Discussion: Challenges</h2>

<p>Talk about what problems you might anticipate, and what to do about them.</p>

<h4>Some issues:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Student is in the wrong class level</li>
<li>Student is disruptive</li>
<li>Student is disengaged</li>
</ul>

<p>DISCUSS!</p>

<h2>Discussion: Coaching</h2>

<h4>What are the benefits of having two coaches in a group?</h4>

<h4>How can you divide the roles between the coaches?</h4>

<h4>How can you get a good dynamic between the whole team, both attendees and coaches?</h4>

<p>DISCUSS!</p>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="coaching_build_a_team">
<h2>Coaching: Build a Team</h2>

<ul>
<li>ClojureBridge normally makes a distinction between coaches and TAs (teaching assistants).</li>
<li>We will try to form groups with two coaches per group.</li>
<li>You can decide on one coach to take the lead, or you can tag-team.</li>
<li>There will also be some "floating" TAs that can go around ang help.</li>
</ul>

</section>
    <section class="slide" id="coaching_dynamics_ideas">
<h2>Coaching Dynamics (Ideas)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Talk with your co-coach beforehand to set expectations</li>
<li>It can make sense to have one person take the lead</li>
<li>The other coach can give more individual assistance</li>
<li>Swap these roles around if it makes sense. Find a healthy dynamic!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Co-coaching (Some Ideas)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Both coaches can ask questions to encourage students to speak up.</li>
<li>Ask your co-coach to explain a concept; they may be more technically advanced than you!</li>
<li>Co-coaches can help people who get lost.</li>
<li>If someone falls behind, the co-coach can take them aside to do some 1-on-1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion: Comprehension</h2>

<h4>How can you tell if they understand the words you're saying?</h4>
