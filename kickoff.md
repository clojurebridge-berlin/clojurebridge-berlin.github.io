title: ClojureBridge Third Edition, Kickoff Meeting
permalink: /kickoff/
---

Coming autumn we will hold our fifth ClojureBridge Berlin workshop. Organizing a workshop is a lot of work, and so we want to kick things off early and spread the work out over the coming months.

We want to invite everyone who wants to play a part in organizing this workshop to come and kick-off this workshop. In particular we invite past attendees and coaches who want to pay it forward and play a more active role in ClojureBridge.

There will be a short presentation about what goes into organizing, the tasks, timeframe, and way of working. You won't have to commit to anything yet, you are welcome to come and listen, and then decide afterwards what role you see for yourself. There will be both bigger and smaller roles, so it's up to you what kind of time commitment you are able to make.

We will then discuss and decide on key dates for the workshop and talk about what we would like to see in the next workshop.

There will be vegan snacks!

**Code of Conduct**

As with all our events, this meetup will be covered under the Berlin Code of Conduct. Please familiarise yourself with it if you have not yet: [Berlin CoC](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/); and let us know via email or in person at the event if you have any issues.

**Accessibility/Elevator**

There is an elevator in the building, it requires a key to operate. We will post a number to call for the key on the door downstairs.

Note from the venue:

Unfortunately the building managers denied our request to rebuild the bathrooms to be accessible, so the closest such bathroom is in SÃ¼dblock (Admiralstr. 1-2): [wheelmap](http://wheelmap.org/map#/?zoom=19)
If the elevator is making a loud, high-pitched noise, please move away from the light barriers & push the reset button above the buttons to choose a floor. The elevator will then move to the closest floor. Push the button of the floor you want after it stops so it takes you where you need to go.
